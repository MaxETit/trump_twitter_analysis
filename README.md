# trump_twitter_analysis
An analysis of Trump's Tweets. This is the first substantial project I undertook by myself. It's purpose was to try and use some of the techniques I have learnt over the last few months in Python, Pandas and Tableau. There are definite areas of improvement and I have outlined those in the course of the project.

Tableau does not seem to want to render on GitHub, so view via nbviewer (accessible on file page), or alternatively:
